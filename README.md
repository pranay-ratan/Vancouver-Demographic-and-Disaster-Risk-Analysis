# Vancouver-Demographic-and-Disaster-Risk-Analysis

This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to visualize Vancouver's demographics and disaster risks. The project aims to provide insightful visualizations for population, language, walk scores, flood, liquefaction, and ignition risks to facilitate urban planning and preparedness.

## Overview
This project was developed to enhance emergency management during and after natural disasters, focusing on community resilience through advanced technology and data-driven strategies.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Visualizations of Vancouver's population by Forward Sortation Area (FSA).
- **Healthcare Workforce Analysis**: Data on the distribution of healthcare professionals.
- **Disaster Risk Mapping**: Identification of areas at risk for natural disasters such as floods, liquefaction, and ignition.
- **Urban Planning Insights**: Actionable insights for policymakers to enhance urban development and disaster management strategies.
- **Accessibility**: Hosted on Tableau Public for easy access and collaborative enhancement.

## Files in the Repository
- **Environics.xlsx**: Data file for environmental variables.
- **FloodRiskLevel.xlsx**: Data file for flood risk levels.
- **HousingPrice.xlsx**: Data file for housing prices.
- **Ignition.xlsx**: Data file for ignition risks.
- **LiquefactionRisk.xlsx**: Data file for liquefaction risks.
- **Walkscore.xlsx**: Data file for walk scores.
- **Vancouver Demographic and Disaster Risk Analysis.twb**: Tableau workbook containing the dashboard.
- **presentation.pdf**: Presentation detailing the project.

## Expected Impact
- **Enhanced Communication**: Ensures critical disaster information is accessible to all, breaking down language barriers.
- **Optimized Volunteer Coordination**: Provides real-time insights into ground conditions and volunteer activities, improving response times and resource allocation.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Utilizes predictive analytics to ensure resources are deployed where they are most needed, enhancing overall disaster response effectiveness and equity.

## Proposed Solutions
- **LinguistLink**: Bridges language barriers with universally understandable disaster signs and visual tutorials.
- **GroundScout**: Provides real-time updates on ground conditions using crowdsourced data and predictive analytics.
- **ResourceOptimizer**: Optimizes resource allocation using fire risk data and healthcare workforce distribution.

## Summary
By implementing these features, the project aims to significantly improve communication, volunteer coordination, and resource allocation during disasters. This will make disaster response faster, more efficient, and more inclusive, ultimately enhancing overall community resilience and safety.
